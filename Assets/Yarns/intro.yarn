As the spaceship took off, my last sight of Earth was of mushroom clouds blooming across the horizon.

INTERCOM: ❄︎✌︎😐︎☜︎⚐︎☞︎☞︎ ✋︎💣︎💣︎✋︎☠︎☜︎☠︎❄︎

My name is Tahm. I used to be a surgeon.
Then the 23rd Global Nuclear War happened.

INTERCOM: ☜︎☠︎❄︎☜︎☼︎✋︎☠︎☝︎ 💧︎🏱︎✌︎👍︎☜︎

As we soar into the vast expanse of the stars, the roar of the engines simmers to a low hum.
They are now so quiet I can hear the sobbing of the families around me.

INTERCOM: 💧︎❄︎✌︎👌︎✋︎☹︎✋︎☪︎✋︎☠︎☝︎ ☞︎☹︎✋︎☝︎☟︎❄︎

Now I'm headed for a new planet, to start a new life from scratch.
We fly in silence for a while, as the ship stabilizes and the finality of our decisions sinks in.

At some point, the social workers assigned to our cases roll in from another cabin. Their metal bodies clanging against the metal floors.

🕆︎❒︎⬧︎♋︎: Hello, Tahm.
🕆︎❒︎⬧︎♋︎: Self is 🕆︎❒︎⬧︎♋︎. But please christen self "Paul". 
PAUL: Sorry for Earth.

PAUL: First, about self planet. Is ancient construct. Unknown maker.
PAUL: Sometimes, gears fail. Must replace with self bodies. Hard work.
PAUL: Not possible for human. Too soft. Too fragile. Must find other work.
PAUL: Apologies. Self English ok?
-> TAHM: You're doing great. Better than I can speak 🕈︎□︎❒︎♎︎⬧︎ at least!
    PAUL: 🙰♋︎☺︎♋︎🙰♋︎, thank you Tahm. 
-> TAHM: Sorry, I'm going to need more time with a dictionary.
    We spent those 64 hours going through as much as we could about their planet, their language, and the steps to citizenship.
    Humans are the first organics they have allowed to their planet, after learning about the War on Earth.
    The star cluster that acts as their sun never sets. Instead, it changes color, regularly shifting from red to purple. "4 purples" is the time it takes to see purple 4 times.
    Their planet is an enormous machine made of endlessly spinning gears. When the originals break, a citizen is paid to replace it until they can produce another copy. 95% of the jobs on their planet consist of acting as cogs in the machine.
    Humans, of course, are incapable of performing these jobs. Most of the ones there are factory workers or recycling scavengers.
    Each refugee is given 8 reds and 7 purples of free housing in the refugee sector. In that time we are to find a source of income to pay the citizenship fee, which is ₴{$citizen_goal}.
    If you can't pay the fee, you must return to Earth or be moved to a different planet.
