As I return to the refugee sector, I come across a scruffy looking human child.
CHILD: Hey, Mister. I have a spare medigel pack for sale. ₴5.
<<if $money >=5>>
-> TAHM: I could use that. (BUY MEDIGEL PACK)
    <<set $has_medigel to true>>
-> TAHM: No thanks.
    CHILD: Please, sir, I really need the money.
    -> TAHM: Alright, fine. (BUY MEDIGEL PACK)
        <<set $has_medigel to true>>
    -> TAHM: If you're working in the factory, you might really need the medigel.
        The child turns away sadly, looking for another potential buyer.
<<else>>
-> TAHM: I can't afford that right now.
    CHILD: I really need the money, sir.
    CHILD: Will you buy it if I meet you again next shade?
    -> TAHM: Sure, if I have the money then.
        CHILD: AWESOME!! I'll see you next color!
    -> TAHM: Don't bother. I'm having a hard time finding money too, kid.
        CHILD: I get it.
        The child turns away sadly, looking for another potential buyer.

An A.N.G.E.L. stares at me as I walk back to my tent.
A.N.G.E.L.: 👎︎♓︎⬧︎♑︎◆︎⬧︎⧫︎♓︎■︎♑︎📬︎📬︎📬︎ ⬥︎♋︎⬧︎⧫︎♏︎♐︎◆︎●︎ {$translate_parasite}...
-> TAHM: What did you just say to me?
    <<set $courage +=1>>
    A.N.G.E.L.: Not learn language? Why come? Lazy... parasite.
<<if $translate_parasite is "parasite">>
-> TAHM: I just got back from work. You don't know what you're talking about.
    <<set $courage +=1>>
    A.N.G.E.L.: Fake work. Parasite never joins Divine Construct.
<<endif>>
-> Just let it go.
    <<set $discouraged +=1>>

On my way back to my tent, some guy trips me.
